## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Linux based machine
* NVIDIA速 GPU card with CUDA速 Compute Capability 3.5 or higher
  * NVIDIA速 GPU drivers -- CUDA 10.1 requires 418.x or higher
  * CUDA速 Toolkit -- TensorFlow 2.1.0 supports CUDA 10.1
  * cuDNN SDK (>= 7.6)

### Installation

For Linux-based system, powered by Nvidia GPU with CUDA and CuDNN already installed:
* [install Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#system-requirements)
* Clone the repository onto your machine
```bash 
$ git clone https://github.com/h-beacon/humidity-time-series.git
```
* Go to `humidity-time-series` directory
```bash 
$ cd humidity-time-series
```
* Create new conda environment and activate it
```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml -n hts
$ conda activate hts
```
### Use
